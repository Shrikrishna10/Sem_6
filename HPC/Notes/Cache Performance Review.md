Assume we have a computer where the cycles per instructions is 1 when all mem access hit in the cache. The only data accesses are loads & stores & these total 50% of the instructions. It the miss penalty is 25 clock cycles & the miss rate is 2% how much faster would the computer be if all instructions were cache hits.


Assume the miss rate of instruction cache is 2% & the miss rate of the data cache is 4%. If a processor has CPI of 2 without any mem stalls & the miss penalty is 100 cycles for all misses. Determine how much faster a processor would run with a perfect which would never miss. Assume the freq of all loads and stores is 36%.



# Split Cache
Instruction and data cache is split into 2 different blocks & they operate in parallel
