# Classes of Computers
Five mainstream computing classes & their system characteristics
- Personal mobile devices
- Desktop Computing
- Servers
- Clusters/ Warehouse scale computers
- Embedded computers

## Parallelism at multiple lvls
2 kinds of parallelism are used at multiple lvls
- Data lvl
- Task lvl

## Classes of Parallelism & Parallel Architectures
### Data Lvl Parallelism (DLP)
- Arises because there are many data items that can be operated on at the same time. 
	or
- Simultaneous execution of the same function across the elements of a data set.

### Task Lvl Parallelism (TLP
- It arises because tasks of work are created that can operate independently and largely in parallel
	or
- Simultaneous execution of multiple and different functions across the same or different datasets

Computer Hardware can exploit these 2 kinds of application parallelism **in 4 major ways**
- Instruction-Lvl Parallelism
- Vector Arch 



## Michael Flynn classes of Parallelism & Parallel Arch
### SISD - Single Instruction, Single DataStream
### SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple DataStream

### MISD - Multiple Instruction, Single DataStream
### MIMD - Multiple Instruction, Multiple DataStream
